======

The chance to meet Shri Mataji and to hear Her teachings represented a dramatic turnaround in our lives. Sometimes fast, sometimes slow, visible transformation in our lives occurred, producing a lasting change infused by beauty, serenity, joy, purity, simplicity, collectivity, etc. As an eternal expression of our gratitude towards Shri Mataji, we would like to share some of the Divine Treasures we have delighted our Souls and Spirits with while following Shri Mataji and practicing Sahaja Yoga. In particular, the site includes the complete and unedited Divine Message of Shri Mataji and all its connections with the Spiritual Festivals and Scriptures of the World.

======

Nirmala Salve was born at noon on March 21, 1923. Nirmala means immaculate, and the whole name translates: O Immaculate One, salutations to You.

Her childhood and adolescence, especially Her stay in Mahatma Gandhi's ashram and involvement in India's freedom movement, are documented by family members and several public speeches of different personalities. 

Married in 1947 with Chandrika Prasad Srivastava, She became the mother of two daughters: Kalpana born in 1948 and Sadhana born in 1950. 

Her lifelong mission started publicly on May 5, 1970, when in the early morning hours, while meditating on a beach near Nargol, Gujarat, She witnessed the Primordial Kundalini rising and opening the Primordial Sahasrara Chakra, a culmination point in the spiritual evolution of the mankind. Known since then as Shri Mataji Nirmala Devi, meaning the Holy Mother Immaculate Goddess, the purity emanating from Her being or from Her Photographs in the form of vibrations, the infinite Divine Knowledge contained in Her teachings (talks and writings), and the miracles experienced have deeply touched the lives of seekers. 

Shri Mataji founded Sahaja Yoga in 1970. She established various organizations around the world, including The Life Eternal Trust in India in 1972 and Vishwa Nirmala Dharma in U.S.A. in 1985. 

Shri Mataji visited U.S.A. in 1970, 1972, and each year from 1981 until 2006 except 1998. 

Shri Mataji withdrew from this world on February 23, 2011.
