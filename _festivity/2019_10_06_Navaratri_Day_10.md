<font color="DarkRed">"I am the Ādi Śhakti incarnated. Once this Truth becomes one with yourself, there’s nothing to fear because all Deities know this fact. They know about this Incarnation very well. They’re all prepared for it and they’ll do anything to substantiate your belief.<br>
In every way they are trying to give you My Photographs, in the sky, this, that, I mean all sorts of
things. God knows what they are going to do today. They are so anxious. They are behind the stage, before the stage, all sides of the stage, listening to Me, feeling happy that I am telling you the Truth. But the way they recognize and the way they act, they never disobey.<br>
.......<br>
It’s very remarkable that, not only that you recognize Me as a Mother who loves you very much, but a Mother who is powerful to protect you. Is very powerful. If you realize that and if you feel that within your heart. Supposing I correct you some time, instead of feeling sad you should see that, ‘How fortunate I am that Ādi Śhakti Herself is correcting me. She’s taking interest in me. How fortunate I am to be born at this time, to be with Her in Her great work. What have I done [to deserve this]?’ <b>This recognition itself will fulfill all the Incarnations of Navarātri.</b>"</font><br>

Let Those Who Have Eyes See,<br>
Let She, The Auspicious One, The Great Queen,<br>

<font color="DarkRed">"Now the tenth Navarātri today is to celebrate actually the Ādi Śhakti. So today we are really going to worship the Ādi Śhakti. On one side the Ādi Śhakti is Mahākālī, on the other side She is Mahāsaraswatī, in the center She is Mahālakṣhmī, and also She is the Ambā, the one who is the Kuṇḍalinī. But She's also beyond that. She's Parāśhakti, She's beyond all the powers because She is the Generator of Power, so She has to be beyond all that."</font><br>

Victory to the all-powerful Śhrī Rāma!<br>
<font color="MidNightBlue"><b>Aum Twameva sākshāt Śhrī Rāma sākshāt Śhrī Ādi Śhakti Mātājī Śhrī Nirmalā Devyai namo namah</b></font><br>
O Divine Mother, You are verily Śhrī Rāma. Salutations to You!<br><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"<b>Today especially it's a very great day of Dussehra we call it. This is the day when, as you know, Rāvaṇa was burned. Effigies of Rāvaṇa are burnt all over the place. When Śhrī Rāma came this was done. His victory.</b> But in His victory, it was not that He made Sahaja Yogis or He gave Realization -- No! His victory was that He killed Rāvaṇa. That was done that time for today's preparation, for today's happenings. It was done long time back that these days will come when people will have a proper value system of the victory of Śhrī Rāma. But it doesn't happen, it doesn't happen, because this Incarnation of Mātājī Nirmalā Devī is very different, is very illusive -- Mahāmāyā.
......<br>
So now, <b>I have to just tell you that, on this day of this Pūjā, it's such a combination that it's the Dussehra, I am here and also you can call it the last day of the Devī Pūjā.</b>"</font><br>
