"Today is a very important day for all of us Sahaja Yogis, because today Shrī Gaṇesha was born. Shrī Gaṇesha is whom we worship and because of whom we got our realization. However much you may remember Him, until you do not know His special qualities, you cannot attain Him. His special quality is that He is the embodiment of purity (shuddha swarūp) and complete Master of the Universe. He is the incarnation of the Supreme, of Brahman.<br>
By coming into this world He has created music (sangeet), rhythm (tāl) and notes (sur). By His Grace only people become one with music (talleen). A small boy who came into the world and did such great work! He has given so many things to everyone and even today He is active. Shrī Gaṇesha’s Pūjā, no matter how much you do it, it is not enough. A lot of people say we don’t see Shrī Gaṇesha, even after worshipping Him so much, we do not attain Him."<br>

"So today’s Pūjā is specially to be done with a prayer in your heart that:<br>
'Shrī Gaṇesha, please be kind and merciful and forgiving that You manifest within ourselves.<br>
Let all these hypocritical things, all these conditionings and all these wrong ideas we have or all the wrong life we have had, should just disappear like thin air, and let the beautiful moonlight of your soothing qualities of innocence be manifested through us.'<br>
Let us manifest these qualities. This is what is to be asked."<br>

"So I have to make a very simple announcement today, that on this day of Shri Ganesha, all My children who are born like Shri Ganesha, in the same pattern, should become dynamic like Him, innocent like Him, great like Him, working twenty-four hours. This little Child is working throughout the day and night to give you this source of joy."

"Today cannot be Dwitya, has to be Chaturthi. According to Indian…, you see, is Chaturthi, has to be. Or Chaturdashi, could be. When was this rakhi? (Yogi: Seventeen, sixteen days ago). Sixteen days ago, so it is after rakhi. (Yogi: Two days after new moon). That is, two days after new moon it is. It is, has to be Chaturdashi, fourth day, has to be in Indian time.Because Chaturthi is the day He is established, Ganesha is established on this Chaturthi – because Indian, you see, is different, little bit particular. Must be starting now, about 12 o’clock, Chaturthi."

Your first tooth You have and four holy hands<br>
The blessing, rope and goad<br>
The fourth offers food to your devotees<br>
As they worship their innocent Lord<br>

"So the priorities have to change if Shri Ganesha is to be worshipped. What are we worshipping today is the innocence within us. We are worshipping that is auspicious, which is innocent. Innocence, which is deep down within us - that's our character, that's our nature, that's what we are born with - is the basic of this whole Creation; is the essence of this Creation."<br>
