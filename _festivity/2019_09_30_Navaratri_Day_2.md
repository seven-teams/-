<font color="DarkRed">"When I see here, I don’t know what was the situation at that time in these Western countries, whether there were human beings or not I don’t know; but historically I think it was not such a developed place.<br>
So then all this arrangement was made, and human beings were made to understand that there is God. The Saints were respected – I’m telling you in India – real Saints were respected, and they made different observations. Now when I read say, Ādi Śhaṅkarāchārya, I am amazed how he knows so many things about Me. He knows how My knee looks like, he knows how many lines I have on My back, how many – I mean, it is very amazing how this man knows everything about Me. That means through his meditative power he could envisage Me – he never saw Me. The description and everything is so clear-cut. Now if you say the thousand names of the Goddess, thousand names of the Goddess are so precise. I mean, you can verify them in Me, I am just like that. Whatever it is, good or bad, whatever is said about Me is there, is a fact. And it is the knowledge of these people is most remarkable: how did they know that a Goddess is like that? Certain of My things which I also don’t know, but they are there, and they have described. It’s very surprising.<br>
So their meditative power in India was great. The reason was, our seasons were disciplined, people are disciplined."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"So you are the goddess of the family, you have the śhakti and you have to be very careful. Moreover you are Sahaja Yoginīs so you shouldn't allow your Sahasrāra to be touched by anyone and your power comes from your chastity. Thousands of women in India committed suicide because they didn't want any man to touch their body. Now you are in Sahaj Culture and in Sahaj Culture we have to behave in a very dignified mature manner. When you are small girls you are also goddesses, that time you are innocent, then you get married, it's a very big thing that you are a married woman is very auspicious."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed"><b>"You must pray to God and ask what you want.<br>
Ask for 'Complete satisfaction in my heart, joy in my hear, bliss in my heart, so that the whole world becomes blissful.<br>
Give me love, love that I could love the whole world and that the whole world becomes one in love.<br>
Give salvation to this humanity which is suffering.<br>
Take me to Your feet. Cleanse me with Thy love.' "</b></font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"It’s a great thing today that we are celebrating the Virgin’s worship in England. As you know, according to Sahaja Yoga, England is the heart where resides the Spirit of Śhiva. And that Virgin should be respected and revered and worshiped in England is a great honor, I think, for all the Sahaja Yogis.<br>
Now one has to think why such an importance is paid to a Virgin? Why a Virgin is respected to that extent? What are the Powers of a Virgin? That She can bear a child of that magnitude that was Christ, that She could create Śhrī Gaṇeśha out of Her own body, that She could protect innocent, dynamic force of Her children who are egoless, who have not known what is ego. So this Great Power and Force resides in a person who has lots of pūrva puṇyas, who has done lots of good things in previous lives, who has always understood that Virginity is a power higher than any other power and would save the Virginity and Chastity with all her effort and care. As you know that within our body She is placed as Kuṇḍalinī.<br>
Means She is the Virgin. She is untouched. The desire to become Spirit is without any blemish: Nirmal. There is no blemish. It’s waiting is pure. There is no other desire, but to be one with the Divine. All other desires are finished."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"But Goddess Herself has done so many things for us already, within us, though we are not aware of it.<br>
Is said that, "<b>Ya Devī sarva bhūteshu</b>," "All those whom You have created," means mostly the human beings, 'What do You do?<br>
As what do You exist inside the human beings?'<br>
Now, just introspect if you have these qualities within you or not, because they are given to you by the Goddess, by the Śhakti within you."</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">"The Emblem of the Adi Shakti, of course you know, is a thing like this, you see, is ... we call it a ... a[n] elliptical, isn't it? This is elliptical, elliptical. You all know that. But the mark of the Adi Shakti is the Half-moon and a star. You can put a Half-moon and a Bindu, ...... is a point. But that point is a star. So, you see, the Islam follows the star, the inside, and below that is this, what you call, they call it the Moon. But that’s the half mudrā, or we can call it the half ...... of the coil. But half, according to the Western mind, half means it’s bad. But half is the one that takes everything within itself. You see, the one like the bottom of the sea. Bottom of the sea is always bigger than the sea itself. So this ... the half Shakti takes all the Shaktis into itself. And the Bindu represents the heart or we can say the Atma. So is the complete thing, is the Adi Shakti and the Bindu. That’s the Islam seal. And in the same way this is the seal, this is the seal of the Adi Shakti, is a half-circle. Is not even half -- we shouldn’t say now first night’s Moon and a star. And why this it is used? Because this is the thing coming from the creation, from the nature. So that also what we call Islam is nothing but is the creation of Adi Shakti."</font><br>

She is the one who observes the state of Celibacy.<br>
She is shown as holding rosary in her right hand and a water utensil in her left hand.<br>

Shri Chandraghanta who rides a lion or tiger.<br> 
She has a half-moon shaped like a bell on Her forehead or who uses moon as Her bell.<br>
