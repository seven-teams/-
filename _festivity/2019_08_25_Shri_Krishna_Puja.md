"Today we have gathered here to worship Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa’s incarnation. As you know that Shrī Kṛiṣhṇa is the incarnation of Nārāyaṇa, of Shrī Viṣhṇu. So in every incarnation they carry all their qualities, all their powers and all their nature with them. So when He incarnated He had all the qualities of Nārāyaṇa and then that of Rāma, but every incarnation tries to rectify whatever in their previous life has been misunderstood and have been carried to the extremes. That’s why they have to come back again and again.
So as Shrī Viṣhṇu, when He thought of taking His incarnation, because He is the one who is the preserver. He’s the preserver of this creation and also the preserver of dharma. So when He took His incarnation He had to see that people keep to their dharma. By keeping the dharma all right only, you could get your realization."<br>
