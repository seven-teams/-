<font color="DarkRed">"Today to see you on this Navarātri Day, so many people sitting to worship Me. So many people are here, so many Sahaja Yogis, it’s so remarkable, it is not My achievement, I tell you. It’s your seeking.<br>
Because I have been on this Earth many a times before – that you know. But we never had like this, so many came and got crucified, died, this, that – but I never had people of this caliber.<br>
So again we come to the same point, that we should be aware of ourselves – complete śhraddhā in your Self. <b>If you have some śhraddhā in your Self, you will have śhraddhā for Me also.</b>"</font><br>

<font color="DarkRed">O Devī, we bow before You, who are yourself good fortune in the dwellings of the virtuous, and<br>
ill-fortune in those of the vicious, intelligence in the hearts of the learned,<br>
faith in the hearts of the good, and modesty in the hearts of the high-born.<br>
May You protect the universe!”<br>
<b>Śhrī Mātājī: This is a prayer.</b></font><br>
