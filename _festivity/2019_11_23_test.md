<font color="DarkRed">"Jesus Christ possesses all Powers of Ekādeśha Rudras, that is Eleven Powers of destruction. These powers have their centers located around the cranium of our head. When the Incarnation of Kalki takes place, all these Eleven Powers perform the work of destruction. Out of these Eleven Powers one is that of Śhrī Hanumāna, the other of Śhrī Bhairava. In the Bible, these two powers are named as Saint Gabriel and Saint Michael respectively. After Self-realization in Sahaja Yoga one can awaken these Powers by addressing them in Sanskrit, Marathi or even in English. The nāḍī on our right side, which is known as ‘Piṅgalā nāḍī’, is activated by the Power of Śhrī Hanumāna. Whenever, any sort of pressure or constriction develops inside this nāḍī, it is instantly relieved by Chanting the mantra of Śhrī Hanumāna. Similarly, even by chanting the name of Saint Michael one would experience relief in the Iḍā nāḍī. Iḍā nāḍī is on our left side and manifests the Power of Saint Michael or Śhrī Bhairava."</font><br>
