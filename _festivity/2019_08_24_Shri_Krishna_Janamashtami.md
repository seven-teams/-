"The first job of the Viśhuddhi chakra within us was that, when we became human beings, we raised our heads up like that. When you raise your head up like that, you have become a human being, in the sense that now, there is a new movement in your consciousness. Now the new movement in your consciousness started about 6,000 years back when Śhrī Kṛiṣhṇa came on this Earth. That the new movement was, that it is the Father. The Advent of the Father was celebrated, and that’s how people developed a kind of a new instrument within themselves, called ego."<br>
