After quite a long interruption, we would like to restart the posts of the Scriptures Team.If you would like to be part of the Scriptures Team please let us know. At its peak, the team had 6 members and we would like to restart from scratch. 

The team will aim at high quality posts that combine quotations with commentaries, everything related to and in the light of the Divine Teachings of our Holy Mother. 

Posts could be individual or collective (worked out by subteams), the overall team overlooking to improve the quality as much as possible.

The formats of the posts are flexible, and it includes all old formats and many new ones.

As a first such new format, we would like to start with the Al Qur'ān (Holy Qur'ān). Please have a look at the the link
<a href="">Post 5: Al Qur'ān</a>

Looking forward to your support, feedback, cooperation, and help.
