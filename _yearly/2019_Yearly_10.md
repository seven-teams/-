<b>You have a very great responsibility</b><br>
</p>

"You have a very great responsibility, and that responsibility is to transform the human beings. That's your due: 'How many have you transformed? How many have you changed?' It's all right, for men or women, you have to change people. This is your job and this is the power you have got from Christ: that you have to change them, transform them into the new world of happiness and joy, which we call it as the Sahaj Nirmal Dharma."
