</p>

<p>
"The greatest event was that Vishwa Nirmala Dharma was established and since five to six years has been growing and people are fully involved in it. People are understanding that all the old religions have merged into this new Religion. People who were roaming the temples and mosques are now fully settled in this New Dharma and are trying very hard to establish the Vishwa Nirmala Dharma within themselves. The Tattwa of all Religions is here and a person understands that all the essences are of One Dharma. They are fully absorbed mad established here. Then a new awareness comes to us. Other people will support any dharma and, run after it like and people though there is no dharma in them. Those people are different and we are different from them. By coming to this Dharma our ego vanished, our bad feelings went, and our blind faith finished because this is the Religion of Light, Love and Śhakti. Without the Śhakti nothing is done. When there is love in this power, then it will never do anything that is against the Law of the Divine. It works itself because this Śhakti has knowledge and love and works with full awareness."<br>
