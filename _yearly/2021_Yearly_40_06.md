<font size="+2"><b>Genetics Are Put By Śhrī Gaṇeśha Because He Is The Source of Wisdom</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"I think it is a part of the genetics that people have discretion between good and bad, destructive and constructive.<br>
......<br>
They think their lives are precious and they must live, and live well. But this ordinary, common sense starts missing and they will say, "What's wrong? What's wrong in this? What's wrong in that?" That means: the genetics of the Haṃsa are missing.<br>
......<br>
So these genetics are put by Śhrī Gaṇeśha because He is the Source of Wisdom.<br>
......<br>
So they forget, 'Because they are just now coming to Sahaja Yoga and their genetics are not established of their wisdom.'<br>
......<br>
Once this is established, then all mistakes, all wrongdoings, not only of you, [but also] of your relations, of your forefathers, of your family, of your country, of this world, anything, doesn't touch you. You are aloof from it. And in this Kṛuta Yuga, where this Brahmachaitanya is trying to expose and to punish people for their past karmas, collectively also, countrywise also, will not be able to even touch you. Because the light of this center is extremely powerful. And you will be redeemed of all the fears of whatever you have done before. You'll just be beautiful like lotuses which are come out of the mire, and you'll emit beautiful fragrance all around the world."<br>
