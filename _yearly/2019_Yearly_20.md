<font size="+2"><b>Global Religion And Complete Wisdom In Sahaj Yoga</b><br></font>
</p>

<p>
"So the world divided into so many countries, so many races, so many languages and also their own thinking -- think of a Global Religion was only possible when people got their Realization. 
......
So you are not in charge of Sahaj Yoga. It's like government servants. They are suppose[d] to be servants, but they are the bosses. They become bosses. 

So, the whole understanding should be of complete wisdom in Sahaj Yoga. "<br>
