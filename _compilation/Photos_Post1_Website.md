Dear Sahaja Yogis and Sahaja Yoginīs,

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!

As part of the celebration of the 51st anniversary of the Sahasrāra Day, we are pleased to offer at the Lotus Feet of our Divine Mother and to bring to your attention the <font color="blue"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> website of Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī that was started in 2018. 

<i>The website treasures the eternal moments with Śhrī Mātājī by organizing some of Her Photographs within collections as well as chronologically.</i>
The link to the website is:
<a href="https://eternalmoments.smugmug.com/"> link</a>

Initially the website was thought to help the Festivity Team and all Sahaja Yogis doing research for educational and database purposes. It turns out that it can be used for many other purposes, including broadcasting via zoom and youtube. 

The website has currently 6,379 Photographs of Śhrī Mātājī, including versions. More than half of the Photographs come from 9 collections. Among the 9 collections, 7 of them were shared with us (to work on them by titling them and eventually upload them to the website). The eighth collection is the one of Ray Harris that has been around for many years but not dated. A ninth collection was added as titles for the 1982 to 1984 period Photographs provide invaluable material for the whole database.

We hope very much that you will enjoy the .<font color="blue"><b>Eternal Moments</b></font> website

At this moment we are seeking your feedback on the website and we are considering enlarging the Photo Team, a sub team of CCT.

The Photographs of the website can be currently extracted in many ways, say by copying. Until the Download buttons are activated, the extracted Photos will not come up with their original and displayed titles. But the extraction part suffices for most projects. 

We aim to activate the Download buttons in the next couple of months. Before the activation, we are just looking to:<br>
1. Add at least 3 more biographies.<br>
2. Set the links for all Galleries properly (we thought that this is done automatically, but it seems not to be the case). So we will have to set them all manually or figure it out what automatic thing could be done.<br>
3. Check once more that the Collections either do not have any repetition with the current Collections of Photographs available on the internet.<br>
4. Receive your feedback.

We thank you in advance for any help, support, and feedback. Please write to us at sahajayoga.compilations@gmail.com

Jay Śhrī Mātājī!
